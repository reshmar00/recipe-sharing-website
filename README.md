# Recipe Sharing Website

This is a simple web application for sharing recipes. The frontend is built with React.js, and the backend is built with Django. PostgreSQL is used to store the recipe data. The application is deployed on AWS, with the frontend code hosted on S3 and the backend code hosted on EC2. Additionally, AWS CloudFront is used as a CDN, and a custom VPC with one private subnet is used to enhance security.
